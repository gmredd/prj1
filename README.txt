gmredd prj1: Tracking all misc code
 - image_recog.cpp: Final project in the CVIP. Takes an image with several objects as input and generates several image files - as many as different objects that the program identifies - and writes into the files only the corresponding objects from the image - i.e. sans the other objects and the background.
